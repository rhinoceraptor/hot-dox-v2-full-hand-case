# Summary

This is a full-hand case for Alpaca Keyboards' Hot Dox V2:

The design is intended for you to use the existing acrylic top layers of the case, and only print the bottom case parts so that you can still see the screen. However, I've included printable top pieces if you need them.

Alpaca Keyboards very nicely provided the original .dxf files for the case design for me to share, and they are also included here in case you want to make your own case. This is a fairly large print - about 240x200mm.
